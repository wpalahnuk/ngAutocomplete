# ng-Autocomplete

A simple directive for adding google places autocomplete to a textbox element.

Updated to now use ng-model, should work much better in forms. Can now set an initial value using ng-model. Using the ng-model to set the textbox value does not trigger the autocomplete query.

Tested with angularjs-1.2.4

Uses optional directive parameters, so it won't work with <1.2. If people are interested I'll release a <1.2 version.
